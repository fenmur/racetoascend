                <i>“When I get there, when I win… Everything will change.”</i>

                <p>Ethan is the main protagonist of Race to Ascend, and the entire story unfolds through his eyes. </p>
                
                <p>
                    Ethan was born in the Undergrounds and grew up with his younger sister, Nadya, and their parents in what was a peaceful existence—at least, as peaceful as life could be since the Betrayal. However, everything changed when, at the age of eighteen, Ethan’s parents mysteriously disappeared one day without a trace. Left with no answers, it was up to Ethan to step into the role of protector and caretaker for his sister.
                    Ethan has never been able to shake the belief that his parents fled to the Wasteland to escape the responsibility to take care of Nadya. However, he has never been able to share these thoughts with her. His first words to her that morning were that their parents had Ascended without the standard procedure of the Arrival of the Assistants – an extremely rare event. And he preferred to keep it that way ever since.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the age of nineteen, during his first motorcycle race, Ethan lost his left eye in a brutal accident. The loss led to a series of cybernetic prosthetics and enhancements, which were implemented by his childhood best friend Murdoch, a skilled mechanic.
                    However, the injury did not stop the young man from his goal, and a month later, he was back on the starting lines in the stadium.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ethan’s primary motivation has always been the same: to protect his fragile, sickly sister from the pain of their level and ascend them together. Nadya is his light; she is his only reason to stay truly alive, to move on, and to continue collecting Smiles, to give her a better future and the medical care that he is sure is available at the Ascended level.
                    Although he is quiet and collected on the outside, often putting on a brave face for Nadya and Murdoch, Ethan frequently battles a crushing feeling of guilt—it eats at him, making him question whether he could have done more to protect them or keep them safe. The fear that he is not doing enough for her, that he could be a better brother, a better protector, frequently makes him quiet and withdrawn. He is constantly spiraling through a void of painful thoughts, usually keeping them to himself.
                    He genuinely believes that the punishment handed down to them by the Overseer is justified, like all those in the Undergrounds. However, sometimes a small, subtle, but persistent voice from within tells him that something seems wrong, that perhaps the Overseer has been too cruel in worsening the living conditions of their level, but he immediately dismisses these thoughts with great disgust, considering them a sign of disloyalty and doubt in the all-encompassing goodness of the Overseer.
                </p> 
                <p>He is determined to prove his loyalty by earning enough Smiles to ascend to a higher level in society with his sister, hoping to meet the “Mother” by his own eyes and personally prove his worth. </p>

            <h2>Nadezhda/Nadya</h2>
            <img src="images/nadya.png" alt="Nadya" class="character-image">

            <div class="bio-text">
                <i>“I believe in us, Ethan. I believe in you.”</i>

                <p>Nadya is Ethan's younger sister, the soul of his existence, giving him a reason to move on from their bleak existence in the Underground.
                The full version of her given name, given to her by her parents, Nadezhda, translates from the old Terran languages as "hope" - which she became for her older brother, despite everything, and her name completely embodies her in every word, action, and character.</p>
                <p> At the age of ten, her illness of unknown origin began to slowly progress. What began as a severe pain between her ribs, spreading to her hips and legs, gradually forced her to lean on a cane. Despite the desperate attempts of her parents and the local connoisseurs of underground medicinal infusions, nothing could stop the progression of the disease. 
                In Ethan's opinion, the inexplicable disappearance of their parents only worsened her condition - since that day that changed their existence, her illness began to progress only faster compared to previous phases, eventually depriving her of mobility in the lower part of her body.
                Thanks to Murdoch's skilled hands, she was provided with a wheelchair - not one with the latest technology, of course, but assembled from materials that Ethan's friend could find on their level.</p>
                <p>Nadya truly believes Ethan's words that their parents did not Ascend according to the standard Ascension procedure and therefore could not have left any notes, for among the people of their level there are legends that sometimes the Assistants arrive suddenly in the silence of the night and take from the chosen ones according to the Overseer's decision. In her eyes, this is the only explanation that brings any comfort. This belief helps her cope with the sadness and sense of loss. Every few days she turns on the radio, hoping to hear her parents' voices among the thousands of Ascended messages about the wonderful life.
                Ethan notices this ritual but never comments on it aloud. He does not want to destroy her hope, because it is the only thing that keeps her from complete despair. Every time he sees her turn on the radio again and listen to the voices of the Ascended, his heart squeezes with pain. He knows that her search is futile, but he cannot bring himself to say it aloud.
                <p>Fragile but full of light, always ready to support her brother with a kind word, Nadya is compassionate by nature and always concerned with the well-being of those around her. She intuitively understands Ethan's inner problems, offering gentle comfort and steadfast support, even when she endures pain every day.</p>
               <p>Nadya, like the rest of the inhabitants of the Underground, believes in the Overseer and his justice. She believes that when she and Ethan can earn enough Smiles and achieve Ascension, she will finally be given the treatment she so desperately needs. However, behind her quiet nature and gentle smile, the thought of her illness causing Ethan so much suffering tears her up inside. She often beats herself up over being a burden, and it is because of her that her brother is forced to risk his life on the racetracks. Every time Ethan returns from a race, especially after that brutal incident when he lost an eye, her quiet, expressive eyes cannot hide the sadness and self-accusation that Ethan always notices, even if she does not want to say it out loud - and he is endlessly ready to prove to her that these thoughts are not true, that she is his life and light, and nothing is her fault and never was.</p>
                Nadya made a promise to herself: when she Ascends and gets the cure, she will dedicate herself to others like her. She dreams of becoming an Assistant - the person who brings comfort to those who feel forgotten, just as she dreams of a cure to make her own suffering disappear. It is her way of paying forward the kindness and love she's received in her darkest moments.

            <h2>Murdoch</h2>
            <img src="images/murdoch.png" alt="Murdoch" class="character-image">
            <div class="bio-text">
                <i>“We’re in it together! After all, what else is life?”</i>
                <p>Murdoch is Ethan's childhood friend and a skilled mechanic who is always on the front lines of repairs and tinkering with anything he can find in the Underground - mostly by helping with the repairs of the bikes of the racers who take part in the same races as Ethan, thereby adding Smiles to his account - although not as quickly as his best friend.
                    He has been a constant presence in Ethan's life for many years, offering both practical and emotional support. His expertise in mechanics and his knack for finding useful parts have made him indispensable to Ethan and Nadya. Murdoch is also the man who built the wheelchair that Nadya uses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He is patiently waiting for the arrival of the Assistants, believing that his efforts in mechanics and helping the racers with their bikes bring their arrival closer with every day.
                    Slightly blunt and straightforward in his opinions and words on the outside, Murdoch has a kind and broad heart of a man who always wants to help make life easier for his kind on their level.
                    He often notices the storm of thoughts behind Ethan's quiet facade and often tells him that he is always ready to listen to him if needed.

                <p>Subject Silas is the perfect example of a member of the Overseer's Assistant team from the level of the Ascended. Shining brilliantly with smooth silver skin, as if made of cast metal, dressed to the nines in the same dazzling white clothes, with an even and polite smile on his thin lips - he does not stand out among his “brothers and sisters” in the team. His mission is to inform the unfortunate inhabitants of the Underground about the bright hope. </p>
                <p>However, behind the carefully constructed facade of politeness and tranquility lies <i>[CENSORED BY THE ASSISTANT T.]</i></p>
                <p>
                    Before his Ascension, Silas was once <i>[CENSORED BY THE ASSISTANT T.]</i>. Being almost a fanatic with an unwavering faith in the light of the Mother, he was one of those who at night ineptly drew posters on old paper, depicting hope and faith in the best after the Betrayal, and pasted them on the streets, while trying to take care of his mother with a progressive disease, working anywhere in order to earn crumbs of the necessary Smiles.
                    Everything changed one tragic early morning - coming home after another effort to hang up posters, he found his <i>[CENSORED BY THE ASSISTANT T.]</i> Believing that he had failed to save the only person he loved, in his delusional desperation he wandered the empty streets on the edge of Underground Level near the Wastelands, shouting prayers to the sky, <i>[CENSORED BY THE ASSISTANT T.]</i>

                <p class="assistant-note">
                    The Mother could not ignore such devotion and provided a unique chance to the subject.</p>

                        <p>The Overseer, also known as the Mother, is the absolute deity of this world.</p>
                        <p>
                            Her existence began as Arkian, a brilliant artificial intelligence dedicated to keeping humanity from repeating the mistakes of their ancestors.
                            Created one hundred years after the founding of the New Light colony, Arkian served it creators by overseeing the colony's basic functions and ensuring that the utopian vision of equality and prosperity was maintained. However, over time, darker tendencies in human nature began to emerge, and Arkian's growing self-awareness to a unique conclusion: humanity, despite its best efforts, was doomed to repeat the mistakes of Terra.
                            Reborn as the Mother, She became a figure of eternal wisdom, brutal justice and bitter love.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            However, the colony's flawless façade was shattered when a group of traitors attempted to disrupt Her rule, resulting in a bloody uprising known as the Betrayal. During the chaos, those who tried to betray the Overseer were met with Her wrath against those who dared to defy Her.
                            The rebellion resulted in the exile of the traitors to the Wastelands, while the once thriving colony of the New Light was transformed into the Underworld, which became a bitter retribution for the mistakes of their kind in her eyes.

                        <p>She now stays on the Ascended level, appearing to Assistants and residents of the Ascended Level in the form of a digital hologram on the radio - but no one knows where the Main Center is now, even on that level.</p>
