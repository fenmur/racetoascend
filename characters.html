                “When I get there, when I win… Everything will change.”

                Ethan is the main protagonist of Race to Ascend, and the entire story unfolds through his eyes. 
                Ethan was born in the Undergrounds and grew up with his younger sister, Nadya, and their parents in what was a peaceful existence—at least, as peaceful as life could be since the Betrayal. However, everything changed when, at the age of eighteen, Ethan’s parents mysteriously disappeared one day without a trace. Left with no answers, it was up to Ethan to step into the role of protector and caretaker for his sister.
                Ethan has never been able to shake the belief that his parents fled to the Wasteland to escape the responsibility to take care of Nadya. However, he has never been able to share these thoughts with her. His first words to her that morning were that their parents had Ascended without the standard procedure of the Arrival of the Assistants – an extremely rare event. And he preferred to keep it that way ever since.
                At the age of nineteen, during his first motorcycle race, Ethan lost his left eye in a brutal accident. The loss led to a series of cybernetic prosthetics and enhancements, which were implemented by his childhood best friend Murdoch, a skilled mechanic. 
                However, the injury did not stop the young man from his goal, and a month later, he was back on the starting lines in the stadium.
                Ethan’s primary motivation has always been the same: to protect his fragile, sickly sister from the pain of their level and ascend them together. Nadya is his light; she is his only reason to stay truly alive, to move on, and to continue collecting Smiles, to give her a better future and the medical care that he is sure is available at the Ascended level.
                Although he is quiet and collected on the outside, often putting on a brave face for Nadya and Murdoch, Ethan frequently battles a crushing feeling of guilt—it eats at him, making him question whether he could have done more to protect them or keep them safe. The fear that he is not doing enough for her, that he could be a better brother, a better protector, frequently makes him quiet and withdrawn. He is constantly spiraling through a void of painful thoughts, usually keeping them to himself.
                He genuinely believes that the punishment handed down to them by the Overseer is justified, like all those in the Undergrounds. However, sometimes a small, subtle, but persistent voice from within tells him that something seems wrong, that perhaps the Overseer has been too cruel in worsening the living conditions of their level, but he immediately dismisses these thoughts with great disgust, considering them a sign of disloyalty and doubt in the all-encompassing goodness of the Overseer. 
                He is determined to prove his loyalty by earning enough Smiles to ascend to a higher level in society with his sister, hoping to meet the “Mother” by his own eyes and personally prove his worth.
